Influencer Marketing Intern,Claim,United States,3 days ago,,Internship,Other,Marketing and Sales,Software Development,"TL;DRClaim is a rapidly growing social rewards app backed by world-class investors like Sequoia Capital. We’re at the forefront of transforming how brands and customers connect online, redefining the future of shopping and advertising.We’re looking for a scrappy, creative, and social-savvy intern to help power our top-of-funnel outreach to creators across Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. You’ll be on the front lines of our influencer program—finding, researching, and pitching creators who align with our brand.What We're BuildingClaim is a delightful way to save money when you try new brands with friends.Claim is a category-creating social commerce app. The platform pays consumers cash-back to eat and shop while matching brands with loyal customers.Every week on the app during The Drop, Claim combines real-time purchase data and AI to Drop cash-back rewards (Claims) to our Gen Z user base, paying them back to visit QSRs, restaurants, coffee shops, and other brands they’ll love.Claim transforms customer acquisition and retention for partner brands by offering a risk-free reward to acquire customers and bring them back until they’ve built a habit - guaranteeing ROI.Consumers experience the magic of receiving cash back when they swipe their cards at partner brands like Sweetgreen, Blank Street, Levain, and more.The platform’s unique pay-per-acquisition model offers marketers a risk-free growth channel with reliable results and real-world engagement.On Claim, brands replace ads with rewards to win the hearts and wallets of the next generation.This frictionless experience is the core of what makes Claim successful, so if you decide to interview, we’ll add you to the app so you can try it for yourself.How Our Business Model WorksWe charge brands when customers convert on their offers.Today, marketers face significant challenges. Claim simplifies their path to acquiring loyal customers.For marketers at restaurants and quick-service brands, reliably acquiring new customers is incredibly tough. Traditionally, they rely heavily on platforms like Meta, Google, or TikTok - channels that often leave them uncertain about true ad effectiveness and provide minimal control over acquisition costs for quality customers or ""regulars"". Marketers frequently express a strong desire to better understand and control store traffic while shifting spend away from these costly, opaque channels.Claim addresses these exact pain points directly.When users securely link their credit cards through Plaid, we gain insights into their purchase behaviors, including brands they love and those they haven't yet discovered. Leveraging this rich data, Claim matches brands to verified net-new customers poised to become regulars.Brands using Claim can precisely set their cost-per-acquisition (CPA) for a consumer's first few purchases upfront by selecting their reward values and only pay Claim when they successfully acquire or retain a new customer. This pay-for-performance approach makes Claim more reliable, transparent, and cost-effective than traditional advertising platforms.Simply put, Claim repurposes the majority of ad budgets directly into cash-back rewards for high-potential new customers, with Claim earning a small take rate on each purchase. It's a win-win scenario for everyone involved (except traditional ad platforms).We are early on our journey to becoming a leading global rewards platform but we have paid our users millions of dollars to eat and shop, raised $20M from leading investors, and have partnered with some of the world's top brands, including Sweetgreen, Shake Shack, Blank Street Coffee, Gong Cha, Van Leeuwen, Levain, [solidcore], and many others. Our rapid adoption is a testament to marketers recognizing Claim’s tangible, immediate value in building a base of loyal, repeat customers.Our TeamWe think culture and values matter (a lot), so we recommend reading our culture doc.We’re a close-knit team that’s ready to change consumer internet. The best way to learn about us is by reading our culture doc — we wrote this document together, and we’ve updated it as the company has grown. If the values resonate, you’ll likely enjoy working with our team.We're fortunate to be backed by world-leading investors:The RoleWe’re looking for a social-savvy intern to join our marketing team and help us grow our influencer network from the ground up.You’ll play a key role in top-of-funnel outreach — identifying creators, pitching them on Claim, and supporting our team in building scalable systems for creator discovery.This is a great opportunity for someone who’s passionate about creators, Gen-Z culture, and early-stage startups. You’ll work closely with the our Creator Partnerships & Community Lead and get a behind-the-scenes look at how an influencer campaign runs end-to-end.Key ResponsibilitiesSourcing and curating lists of high-potential creators (5K–250K followers) across social platformsCurating weekly lists of creators across TikTok and Instagram using keywords, trends, and niche communitiesCrafting personalized DMs and outreach messages to connect with creatorsOrganizing leads and tracking responses via Notion and Google SheetsStructure/CommitmentThis is a remote part-time role with a 4-5 hour/day commitment (20-25 hours/week).
