Robotics Supply Chain Intern/Associate,Matic Robots,"Mountain View, CA",1 month ago,,Internship,Full-time,Management and Manufacturing,Robotics Engineering,"OverviewMatic is bringing families out of the stone age of remarkably dumb disc home robots. Humanity spends ~2.5 trillion hours annually on home chores, worth $25 trillion in wasted economic value. We are on a mission to recapture this time and value with fully autonomous, useful, elegant, and affordable Wall-E-esque home robots that families love and cannot fathom their lives without.Our approachIn 2017, we observed 200+ self-driving car startups and an equal number of industrial robotics startups, but the home autonomy and robotics space had been dramatically overlooked. While AI is becoming more ubiquitous, families are still stuck spending dozens of hours per week on repetitive household chores.At Matic, we're leveraging advanced technology to address this problem. We've started by reimagining our first product in fully autonomous floor-cleaning robots. Just like consumers adopted Cell Phones, then PDAs, then iPods and Blackberries before adopting the iPhone to replace all, we believe that consumers will adopt single-purpose, elegant, and affordable robots that belong and become part of their homes first before we get one-robot-to-rule all chores.Our goal is to continue automating other forms of household labor, shipping useful, affordable, and privacy-first robots to our users that solve real problems while building iteratively toward more complex tasks and capabilities over time.Privacy firstOur robots are also private by design, with all the computes on the edge device. We believe that families shouldn't have to jeopardize their privacy just to get some help with the constant drudgery of home chores.Who We AreWe are a consumer robotics product company solving real customer problems. We start with a problem, think of an elegant solution in the form of robots, and conduct necessary research to build products that just work. We believe families want solutions to their problems, and AI & robots enable us to solve them.Who We Are NOTWe are NOT a Robotics Foundation Model research lab, a humanoid builder, or a robotics software platform company.

          New York is leading the nation in the fight on global climate change and the transition to a clean energy-powered economy. The Climate Act has created the most aggressive climate change goals in the nation and requires an ambitious agenda that blends proven catalysts with innovative approaches while operating across a broader energy arena that is rapidly evolving. New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (NYSERDA) is a driving force in realizing this agenda.

We ask for a minimum of 12 weeks, full-time and on-site, for most internships. Our internship program is for students who are actively enrolled in an academic program. Recent graduates seeking employment after graduation and not returning to school should apply for full-time positions, not internships.International Students: If your work authorization is through CPT, please consult your school on your ability to work 40 hours per week before applying. You must be able to work 40 hours per week on-site. Many students will be limited to part-time during the academic year.Internship Program at TeslaThe Internship Recruiting Team is driven by the passion to recognize and develop emerging talent. Our year-round program places the best students in positions where they will grow technically, professionally, and personally through their experience working closely with their Manager, Mentor, and team. We provide an experience that allows the intern to experience life at Tesla by including them in projects that are critical to their team’s success.About The TeamCraftsmanship is the perception of quality that a customer has about a product, derived through sight, touch, sound, and scent. The Tesla Craftsmanship team is responsible for ensuring that all Tesla products have the highest level of perceived quality so they are utterly compelling in the store and provide a faultless experience during use.How do we do it? At the early stages we work with the Product Management teams to quantify the required product content, the Design Studio to identify and resolve any issues relating to the concept, the Engineering and Dimensional teams to develop achievable, world-class gap and flush targets, and the Manufacturing and Quality teams to identify and prioritize issues during pre-production and launch.What You'll DoUnique aspects of an internship in the Craftsmanship team include:Broad vehicle exposure – We get involved in the design and engineering of all customer-facing systems, from seats to interior trim to exterior systems. Embedded in the Engineering team, this broad exposure makes for a huge variety in projects, cross-functional interaction, an ability to have a broad impact to the end product, and accelerates understanding of the design detail of multiple systems across the vehicle Target Setting, Communication and Validation – We set measurable engineering targets that will deliver world-class craftsmanship through competitor vehicle benchmarking and data analysis; validate those targets through physical models, mockups, and using digital visualization tools; communicate and negotiate those targets with the wider Engineering and Studio teams, ensuring that they are achievable; and support the Engineering and Manufacturing teams in meeting those targets Quantification of Customer Feeling – Much of what the Craftsmanship team does is turning subjective customer perception into objective engineering targets by quantifying the premium look, sound, or feel of a system, and identifying all the sensory inputs that will deliver a “wow” experience. For instance, the premium feeling of an armrest that is not too soft or hard, not too thick or thin is quantified with an engineering specification graph that defines force and deflection What You'll BringCurrently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Design or a related field Strong communication and influencing skills An inherent attention to detail and an understanding of the factors that create a perception of exceptional quality in the mind of the consumer An understanding of the fundamentals of good design and user experience, as well as the engineering fundamentals that facilitate delivery of the design An appreciation for the impact and contribution to dimensional variation in assemblies Some understanding of statistical analysis would be advantageous An appreciation of how subjective data can be measured or quantified to develop robust, representative Craftsmanship targets Good level of numeracy, literacy and logical reasoning skills BenefitsCompensation and BenefitsAs a full-time Tesla Intern, you will be eligible for: Aetna PPO and HSA plans > 2 medical plan options with $0 payroll deduction Family-building, fertility, adoption and surrogacy benefits Dental (including orthodontic coverage) and vision plans.
